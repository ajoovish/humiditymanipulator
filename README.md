Humidity and Temperature Manipulator

We use a Microcontroller manufactured by the company Atmel viz. AT89S52. This microcontroller will be operated by using a number of supporting peripherals. A humidity sensor is used in order to sense the humidity of a particular test area. This analog data is sent to the ADC (Analog to Digital Converter, Due to humidity being an analog signal and the AT89S52 operates only on digital values). This data is sent to AT89S52, which then compares the value of the humidity with a set of standard values which are pre-defined and entered by the user into the Microcontroller (i.e. AT89S52). After the Comparison a result is obtained and corresponding voltage is given as output. This output is then given to the driver circuit in order to help power the Fan (because the maximum output of AT89S52 is 5V while the minimum voltage used to drive the fan is 8V to a maximum of 12V). The Driver circuit is connected to the fan and the fan runs at the speed corresponding to that voltage.
